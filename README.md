# Vertex AI's Generative AI Studio

This is a sample use case to witness the interaction between Buyer\_AI(Friend of TIM) and Seller\_AI(Friend of JIM).

By giving a short context to each AI, we witnessed the text conversation happened between two AI's.

## Prerequisites

Create a GCP project with valid Billing account enabled.

Enable Vertex AI API in the project.

## Step to Proceed

Step 1 : Open the GCP Cloudshell ,go to the terminal and clone this Repository  

Step 2 : Set your project in the cloudshell

```BASH
gcloud config set project <project-id>
```

Step 3 : Navigate to the seller\_ai\_vs\_buyer\_ai.py, update your project id and region in the python code line number 4

Step 4 : Do pip install

```BASH
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 5 : Run the Python file

```BASH
python seller_ai_vs_buyer_ai.py
```

YaYYYYYYYYYY!!. Explore the output generated by two AI's.

By Re-Running the code you can also generate mutiple sample outputs.

## NOTE:  BY giving concrete context you can also expect better and depthin info interaction between the AI's
